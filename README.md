> In the neon‑lit information superhighways of our pale blue dot’s sprawling cyberspace ϵcumϵnopólis, “dotfiles” contain “hidden” specifications that power the digital prostheses＆augmentations of our increasingly transhuman existence… They’re the underlying bespoke cybernetic‑implants that give our 𝗖ommand‑𝗟ine 𝐈nterfaces ⟦[`CLI`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)⟧ tools＆low‑level scripting languages their edge.

* Augment your PDEs (“𝐏ersonal 𝐃evelopment 𝐄nvironments”) with the digital‑graffiti of [`.dotfiles`](https://github.com/BFGriffith/dotfiles/wiki) worthy of a tech‑savvy rebel. Cultivate `1337` configurations of your idiosyncratically favored tools, empowering you to hack＆slash through remote digital wildernesses or securely firewalled‑gardens with finesse. From customizing every “Ghost” in your `Shell` prompts until you are their “Puppet Master” to fine‑tuning your favorite `Text‑Editors` or their [`LSP`](https://langserver.org) implementations, [`.dotfiles`](https://github.com/BFGriffith/dotfiles/wiki) are your passport to dominating any virtual cyberpunk underground that your conscious wetware might wish to locally inhabit or temporarily “remote” into…

* This repository is a curated collection of multifarious enhancements＆configurations that may be of interest to coders of many persuasions, ranging from “Cheshire Cats” to “Mad Hatters” and beyond; dive into its code to discover various hopefully sane “opinionated defaults” or easily customizable settings for a plethora of popular tools, such as:
- `“Bash”＄“𝐁ourne‑𝐀gain” Unix 𝐬𝐡ell`: Configure this traditionally popular default shell of most Linux distros to wield the power of its reliably capable command‑line‑interface like a cybernetic samurai.
- `zsh`: Level up your shell game with enhanced features＆customizations for this popular MacOS default shell that enhances Bourne with some popular features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh…
- `Vim`: Embrace the power of modal editing and transform your text‑editing experience into a cybernetic dance of motions so efficient they’ll render your mouse an unnecessary paperweight, eventually forging you into a true console‑cowboy!
- `Tmux`: Master the art of terminal‑multiplexing to take control of your command‑line sessions like Agents traversing The Matrix no matter where you need to remote SSH.
